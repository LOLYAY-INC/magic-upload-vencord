## Frequently Asked Questions
<h3 id="install">How do I install a BetterDiscord plugin?</h3>

To install a BetterDiscord plugin, you'll need to have BetterDiscord installed and navigate to `Settings` > `Plugins` in Discord. From there you'll be able to click on `Open Plugins Folder`. Then all you have to do is add the file `MagicUpload.plugin.js` into your plugins folder.

<h3 id="security">Will anyone have access to my Google Drive?</h3>

<b>Nope!</b> When you sign in with Google, an http server is started in the background that server listens for the response from Google. Meaning that there is no middleman intercepting your OAuth tokens. They are stored locally on your computer only and as an added layer of protection, encrypted before being stored on disk.

However nothing is 100% secure, so if you feel like your tokens are ever comprimised, please <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521?hl=en">remove the application</a> from your 3rd party applications ASAP.
